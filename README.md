Hi, I'm Stormwrecker. I work in Python and Pygame. Most of the stuff I do is for commercial purposes, so generally you won't see too much stuff here other than systems, tests, or just random projects.
I like messing around with socket-networking, general Raspberry Pi setup, etc., but I mostly like trying new stuff in Pygame.

(Currently, I only have one game, but it's worth checking out)

(Older videos are some LEGO stop-motion films; Newer ones are devlogs for my first game)
